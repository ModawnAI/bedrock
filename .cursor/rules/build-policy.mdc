# Build Policy - MANDATORY RULE

## **CRITICAL: Never Build Without Permission**

- **NEVER run `npm run build`** without explicit user permission
- **NEVER run build commands** (`build`, `build:analyze`, etc.) automatically
- **ALWAYS ask for permission** before running any build command

## **Required Development Workflow**

- **ALWAYS run `npm run dev`** after making code changes
- **Use development server** to test changes in real-time
- **Only build when user explicitly requests it**

## **Approved Commands After Changes**

✅ **DO:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

❌ **DON'T:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run build:analyze
rm -rf .next && npm run build
```

## **Exception Handling**

- If user says "build" or "test build" → Ask for confirmation
- If user says "deploy" → Ask for confirmation before building
- If user says "check if it works" → Use `npm run dev`, not build

## **Enforcement**

This rule applies to:
- All file changes and updates
- All component modifications
- All configuration changes
- All dependency installations

**Remember: Development server (`npm run dev`) shows changes instantly without the overhead of full builds.**
